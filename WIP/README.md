# Hosted:

Set up in the same manner as other projects, but Hot Reload is lacking for Hosted project types.  A full build will build the `*.min.css` bundle as expected; `npm run watch` does its job, but Hot Reload won't pick up the CSS changes.

Any info about getting this to work, see issue [#5](https://github.com/McNerdius/TailBlazor-Templates/issues/5).

Hopefully it'll be template-worthy at some point. ðŸ¤”
